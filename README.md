Here I will keep track of my progress learning Go-lang, by starting off with a simple program and increasing the complexity of the code. The end goal is to become as fluent in Go as I am in C. Each program will build upon the last.

## Tasks

- [x] Basic hello/goodbye world [[Source Code]](hello)
- [x] Basic math, semantics, integers and arrays [[Source Code]](math)
- [ ] Usage of multiple files
- [ ] Usage of imported dependencies
- [ ] Create and parse structs
- [ ] File operations
- [ ] Create a graphical display context
- [ ] Interact with mouse and keyboard
- [ ] Display an image
- [ ] Sort an array of data
- [ ] Write formatted data to a file

## Milestones

- [ ] Convert one of Diablo's dungeon generation algorithms to Go
- [ ] Make a program to convert one image format to another
