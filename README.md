Here I will keep track of my progress learning Go-lang, by starting off with a simple program and increasing the complexity of the code. The end goal is to become as fluent in Go as I am in C.

- [ ] Read multi-dimensional arrays
- [ ] Create and parse structs
- [ ] File operations
- [ ] Create a graphical display context
